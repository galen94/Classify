This project, built with Java, allows a user to become more familiar with classical music by using an interactive selection and listening process. There are five columns of buttons: Composer, Performer, Emotion, Language, and Type of Piece. The user will need to choose only one filter/word from each column in order to select and listen to a song. At this point, they can add the single song to a list of favorites, if they'd like to. The list of favorites also allows a song to be selected to listen to. A driving factor of the visible filtration system is that the user can see all of the options associated with a certain filter instead of just guessing and hoping to come out with a song that matches what they chose. What showing this filtration system to the user does is create a better learning process by not only showing the user the consequences of their choices, but giving a visual aid to the concept of music.
