Galen Otten
Final Project 
README

	This project allows a user to become more familiar with classical music by using an interactive
selection and listening process. There are five columns of buttons: Composer, Performer, Emotion,
Language, and Type of Piece. The user will need to choose only one filter/word from each column in order
to select and listen to a song. At this point, they can add the single song to a list of favorites, if they'd like to.
The list of favorites also allows a song to be selected to listen to.
	Once a user chooses one filter from a column, all of the other filters in that column will gray out and become
unavailable. In the other columns, the now irrelevant filters, meaning filters no longer associated with
the list of songs after the previous filter, will also become unavailable. 
	To see all of the filter options at once, the user can click on either "Reset" or the "All Eras" button. The user
can also click on the individual era buttons to see only the filters associated with that specific era. A small, but important
aspect of the project is the hovering text descriptions to aid the user in understanding the types of pieces. All of 
the buttons in this column have a short, but informative text when hovering over the button.
	A driving factor of the visible filtration system is that the user can see all of the options associated
with a certain filter instead of just guessing and hoping to come out with a song that matches what they chose.
What showing this filtration system to the user does is create a better learning process by not only showing the user 
the consequences of their choices, but giving a visual aid to the concept of music.
